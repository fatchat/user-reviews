,"Ooooooh","06/03/05",,"I swoon just thinking about this bakery.  It has the best, most rich cookies in the universe.  They are huge, dense, too sweet for some but use great, creative ingredients (ex. their oatmeal raisin cookie uses golden raisins).  Like no other.  Chocolate lovers don't miss the Mocha Cookie.  ooooh it's like eating crunchy espresso fudge.  I also especially love their oatmeal raisin, their ginger cookies, and their almond cookies with choc or jam filling.  YUM!!!  They also serve Peet's Coffee drinks.  On the other side of the bakery they serve good sandwiches

,"Fantastic Life & Relationship Coach","11/19/08",,"What makes Lisa Shield stand out as an exceptional coach is her sincerity, patience, and keen insight into the heart of any issue. When I recommend her services to friends of mine ? as I often do ? I say that talking to Lisa is like talking to an old friend; someone who listens attentively and can give unbiased, truthful advice. I first went to Lisa when I was having troubles in my relationship, both by myself and with my significant other. Lisa helped us see that what we thought were our problems were only superficial compared to what our bigger issues were ? issues that we weren?t willing or able to recognize on our own. More importantly, she helped us work through those issues over time (now we?re engaged!). I still go to Lisa on a regular basis for help with my career and self-betterment in general. Bottom line, if you?re looking for a life or relationship coach

,"Preston works miracles","07/09/07",,"After losing my go-to stylists and spending three years of trying out different stylists in the city, I finally found the perfect match for my needs! Last fall, Preston set me up with a low maintenance yet stylish cut and color - I was able to go months with a trim or touch up. A few weeks ago, I booked an appointment with Preston and brought in some photos of cuts that were radically different than what I had been doing. He helped me pick the best one for my hair and face, and then proceeded to give me the best haircut I've ever had. I can do anything with it - it's totally versatile and easy to manage. When I got back to the office, people literally stopped in their tracks to compliment my "new hair", saying it completely changed my presence. Since then
,"Great Color and cuts with Preston Nesbit","07/28/07",,"I met Preston on the set of a photoshoot for my dance company when he was doing hair and makeup for the shoot and have been seeing him regularly for my blonde highlights and cuts ever since.  Preston is fabulous!  He is especially talented at choosing the perfect highlights and lowlights to work beautifully with your coloring.  The chemicals he uses also do not dry out my hair the way they have at other salons, my hair actually has looked much healthier since I started working with Preston.  I get so many compliments on how natural and pretty my color looks.  Preston is also wonderful with choosing a stylish cut to frame your face and bring out your features.  He is the kind of stylist you can trust to give you a gorgeous cut and color without even having to ask specifically for exactly what you want.  Often I just plop down in the chair and let him do his magic and I am so happy with the results.",,"-20ad7674:1363fc05114:-1c2b","Acme Head and Body","http://www.insiderpages.com/b/",

They were not personable and it was definately not my money's worth. Then I fell upon BDB! and fell in love! I go to Amanda and she is a sweetheart! The salon is warm and inviting

He thought that I was faking apparently even though I asked for a less strong pain med. He is very unprofessional. I am very naive. I thought it was strange when his nurse called me and told me that cary said he didn't think that he could help me any more. I thought that he did not do injections which I did get in NJ and they helped(this was before I got much worse) When I asked my Dr. for my records, I saw a letter from Dr. Cary that said I was displaying drug seeking behavior. If he thought this about me, he should have discussed this with me. Get your records from your Dr. See if he has any nice things to say about you. This happened to me last year. Thankfully, I am much better now and have been back to work for quite some time. I do not wish anything bad on anyone but I do hope that he experiences what I didand I do not understand why he became a PAIN SPECIALIST?? I understand that a lot of people do go to the hospital or Dr. for narcs, I am a nurse. If he is truly caring he could have talked to me. He didn't even have the decency to cal me, he had his nurse call. I am still upset with him but who knows maybe one day I will have the fortune of taking care of him in the hospital.

,"Not much of a place","08/02/06",,"I would not recommend this company. They are a national company that hires therapists as independent contractors who live locally in the area where the job is located. They find their therapists by searching online for those with websites. Have you seen some of the massage therapy websites? Not all of them have good intentions! While they do require training, they do not have a minimum number of hours of training that they require. They also do not ask for references, do background checks - nothing. They are then sending these people into your home and office sight unseen! Unfortunately, not all massage therapists are honest, ethical or moral. Also, they do not treat their therapists very well. I have a friend who recently worked an event for them and they treated her very disrespectfully. She will not work for them again.

,"Eat & Watch your movie at the same time at Raleighwood","06/08/05",,"Raleighwood provides the best of both worlds--a restaurant and a movie theater.  You watch a movie while eating.  The waiters come to your table shortly after the movie begins and ask you what you would like to order.  (You are not obligated to order anything.)  The only downside to Raleighwood is that sometimes it's distracting to have a waiter talk to you while you're trying to follow a movie.  Drawback to Raleighwood:  They offer movies that are out on DVD/VHS.  Plus the theater's ticket price has increased recently.  It used to cost $3.00 to see a movie (plus whatever food you ordered).  Now, I believe it's $4.50 for a ticket, which is around the price for a daytime matinee at other cinemas.  Considering that Raleighwood shows OLDER movies (that are out on DVD/VHS), $4.50 is too much to charge for admission.  Blue Ridge Theater (Carmike 14) costs only $1.50 for admission and they, too, show older movies that are out on DVD/VHS.  Bottom-line: Give Raleighwood a try and see how you like it.  It's not my favorite theater (by any means), but there are people who find it worthwhile."

Upscale crowd.Unlike other theaters you have to arrive early about 20-30 min before the movie starts so they have time to get your order.  The waitstaff is great but they get rushed with the "late arrivers" who show up seconds before the movie starts and expect the waiters to read the menue to them and answer 20 questions!   Show up early and you will have a great experience.

Although the catfish was very bland it at least was crunchy. They were even gracious enough to have some hot sauce for my baby to swallow the catfish down with. I had the Cheese Manicotti which was excellent! The wine of choice for us was the Moscoto D'Asti. Which was also excellent. My overall feeling about this restaurant was great. A Great first date. Besides being there with Matthew the second best part of my dining experience was when the waitress came over and boxed our food up for us to take with us.

,"Deeeelicious","04/07/06",,"Although parking there is somewhat of a nightmare on a crowded night, the food is absolutely worth the trouble.

I've seen chefs from other restaurants eating a late dinner here, and I've seen the Chief of Police chowing down here.  House special #5, Crispy shrimp pepper-salted, is a totally dependable pleaser.

,"Great Experience!","03/28/07",,"I normally don't write reviews, however, this experience was too good not to share. I have a 22 month old toddler who visited Dr. Kelli Ettelbrick for a general exam and teeth cleaning. When I called to set the appointment, the woman on the phone was very friendly and patiently answered all of my questions about insurance and teeth cleaning.  When we got there, the waiting area had very comfortable chairs and a TV with kids shows playing and plenty of games/toys. The best touch are the large butterfly's hanging from the ceiling throughout the office! We only waited a few minutes to be seen and they took us to the back where they have a wonderful play area for the children. So, my son got to play and watch TV in the back for a few minutes, before he was seen. This was smart on their part because it allows the kids to get comfortable in the presence of dental chairs. Then Dr. Kelli did a quick exam and when she brushed my son's teeth

From the moment you arrive you're treated superbly, the decorations are lovely and most importantly, the food is wonderful. We started out with some delicious champagne (if only we could remember what kind it was), crab cakes, bbq pork, soup, prawns... just perfect. Dinner was spicy beef
,"Mongolian Beef Finally","04/04/05",,"3/10/2007 Ordered the Potstickers and Mongolian Beef again. The Potstickers are good and are cooked properly, but they are not plump like the ones in San Francisco.   The beef, $26, was great as always except that my wife's order had some thick pieces where the meat was raw.  This upset her appetite and is just not acceptable in a place of this caliber.  It may be a sign of the beginnings of decline. 4/5/2005 I have eaten at many chinese places in search of a mongolian beef that is as good as Yangtze in Berkeley.  It has been at 15 years.  They either do not have the flavor right or the beef is not tender enough.  I will have to say that the Lilly has got it right.  It maybe twice as much as others, but it is worth the price because it is right on.   The prawns were huge, but not very tasty.  The Lilly does not believe in putting a lot of sauce on the plate.  They gave us wonderful candied walnuts as an appetizer.  The attention to detail by the wait staff is excellent.  The one thing that really bothered me was the fact that they charged for steamed rice.  At the prices they are charging a real classy place does not nickel and dime the customers.",

She showed us the styles we had preselected, explained options, answered questions and pulled fabric samples. She was very lowkey and allowed us time to discuss things, checking back with us so we did not have to hunt her down.  I had checked on delivery prices on the web before I left and saw a discrepancy on the store invoice price and the web price, I emailed the Store Manager and she responded promptly with a credit. No problems...excellent service!  The only problem is the store was a drive for us from Long Beach, but well worth it. In addition, the options of sofas

,"Great suits at reasonable prices; Don't end up paying for a department store's overhead at the expense of your suit!","03/21/07",,"This is the first review I have written for CitySearch, but I really wanted to make sure that LS gets the proper recognition it deserves.  I went there on the recommendation of a friend and I think it might be my best find thus far in New York.  I have been living in the city for about two years now and I haven't really found a decent place to get a suit. In my line of business, I have to wear a suit every day and it has been frustrating going to so many of the so-called fancy New York department stores that purport to offer excellent service and tailoring but ultimitely produce a shoddy product.  I keep wanting to tell them -- I don't care about how nice your store looks, just give me a nice suit at a decent price...I was reluctant at first to visit LS because it was on the third floor in some midtown building and I figured that at the prices my friend told me they charged there was no way they weren't cutting corners on the suit, but after seeing my suit and spending time talking to Izzy (the owner) I was convinced -- this place is gold!  Izzy has been in the business for probably more than 20 years, and he personally walks you through every aspect of buying a custom made suit.  He made sure I came back to try the suit on a number of times to make sure that everything I wanted was there and that I was happy with the suit.  The fabrics he uses are really great (he must have a really great deal on the fabrics because he was selling the entire suit for the same price that it would cost me to order the fabrics on their own).  In sum, great place

My girlfriend saw my hair and wanted hers just like it - however, when she went in Lien recommended something different that would be more complimentary for her.  The transformation was amazing!  She looks younger, more vibrant and sophisticated....just what she wanted.I highly recommend Lien she truly is a gifted, intuitive , talented hair artist.  She has the ability to really see and create the look that will compliment you best."

I have to say honestly, I really didn't get how "getting my hair done by this guy" was going to make THAT much of a difference, BUT OH MY GOD. First of all, Chris was amazing! He was sooooo nice and incredibly informative. He really listened to what I wanted (which included still wanting to look like ME and not some high end fashion model). He explained very clearly what he was going to do and somehow, WITHOUT making such a drastic change to my look that I wouldn't recognize myself

But its a work in progress I GUESS!!!! the manager of the learning blocks is sweet and nice so is all the management. well i guess it depends on where you feel more comfortable with your child.

I always wanted to see how she liked the daycare when i picked her up but every time i went there the lady at the desksaw me coming and from outside and called her classroom to get her ready. considering how i already felt about the daycare this really concerned me because i felt like they were hiding something. they would not let me see inside her classroom without giving the teachers warning that i was coming. One busy day when i managed to sneak past the front desk and into her classroom I found all the teachers sitting on the floor ignoring ALL the kids running around. She was in the one year old room then and i noticed kids were ALWAYS getting bit. she also came home on 2 occasions with bruises that the staff could not explain! Another time i picked her up the teacher wanted to change her before we left (makes me think she hadnt been changed in some time) and changed her on a counter top (where they change all the babies) without washing her hands Or wiping off the counter top before OR after the change. I used to be a pre school teacher and have learned that that is unacceptable!!! One time i picked her up during lunch time and I was disgusted!!! The teacher surprisengy wear gloves to feed the kids.........okay so they got that right but i saw one of them feed 2 different kids with the same spoon, another used her hands to push food food up from the kids chin into their mouths and she did this to all of the kids she was feeding without cleaning her hands in between, and then i saw one of the drop the lid of one of the kids bottles on the floor and accidently step on it then she just picked it back up and put it back on the bottle and gave it to the baby!!! no wonder my daughter was getting sick all the time.

I have had wonderful success with his assistance in the alleviation of recent muscular and skeletal problems I've had for the last few years.

,"Well Worth The Time","03/16/08",,"I was not referred to Dr. Avedissian. I past his practice one day and was simply curious, so I walked in a booked an appointment. I am one of those people who is constantly searching for balance ? physically and emotionally. It was not until my visits with Patrick that I realized how limited my knowledge of the human body actually was. And, it was incredibly refreshing to find that, no matter the ailment, the body always holds within it a key that just needs to be uncovered. Ultimately, this is what Patrick does ? he uses his skill to pinpoint the source (which is often surprising) so that it can be addressed. The results are tangible and often instant. I have learned a great deal from being a patient of Patrick?s. I expected to find a doctor who could help make me feel like a healthier person. However, what I did not expect to find is what I value the most ? I am now more in tuned with my own body and a better listener to what it is telling me. And I have developed an appreciation of the connectiveness of all things affecting the body conscious or unconscious

I have lots of injuries from collegiate sports and slight scoliosis and Dr.P has been able to alleviate almost all my aches and pains.  What I dig the most is his approach.  he looks at your injuries but also looks at the big picture as to what you are eating, the vitamins you are injesting, the lifestyle you are leading.  This overall care is really beneficial in getting to the root core of the problem.  Unlike many chiropractors who just want you to keep coming back over and over, Patrick A. is genuinly devoted to figuiring out what is wrong with you and fixing it.

,"Go for the Caviar!","03/07/07",,"I went on Valentine's Day. It was a 7 course pre-fix dinner. Though one thing was disturbing.  The waiter has missed one of our courses and bought out the hearty steak course. Taken that this is a 5 star restaurant, you would think the waiter is knowledgeable enough to realize that it's a faux pas to mix up the order of the course, and would suggest to bring back the steak.  To my surprise, he just told us to eat the steak and will bring out the grilled scallop after that.  Shrug... what can you do.  The food  was enjoyable, caviar was fine.  Service was a bit off.  I had to ask for more wine from my bottle.  I particularly appreciated the caviar.  Perhaps I should?ve just bought a can and eat at the comfort of my own home.",,"-20ad7674:1363fc0addd:-2025"

Over the summer, I had gone to one of those free "our hairdressers just want to try these new colors" clinic things. It was horrible!! They ruined my light-brown/dirty blonde hair by putting almost black lowlights in it! I was so upset I cried every morning when I looked in the mirror. Shanaz saved my hair! She took out all of that awful color, re-did my highlights, and gave me a great trim. I was a different person when I came out of there - a much prettier person! I just went back to re-do the highlights and get another trim, and I have received countless compliments since then.

,"Great Service Start to Finish","03/22/09",,"I have been a FlatRate customer for some time now. Everyone was on time, from the sales manager to quote to the movers. They showed flexibility as I was uncertain of which day the moved would take place. I got calls from the office following up on a regular basis to firm up a move date. They issued the necessary insurance certificates and filed them with both the move-out and move-in buildings and they delivered packing materials prior to move day.I opted for the service where they pack up the kitchen. I just wish they had used less paper. I moved out of an elevator building into a 4th floor walk up and not once did I hear the moving staff complain about the stairs. The move supervisor discussed the entire move plan with me before we began and went about disassembling and assembling furniture - he was an absolute pro and he kept his crew moving.A dispatch supervisor stopped by on the day to check to on things and to make sure all was going to plan.The only negative is that a couple of my big pieces got some minor dings and scratches, but I can't imagine anyone else carrying that stuff up 4 flights without it happening.These guys have treated me well over the years and true to their word, honour their quotes.

There are many preschool and childcare facilities in south Jersey, but I am certain you will not find one that gives the quality of care I found here. The educational program, the care for children's health, the cleanliness of the facility, and friendly teachers should convince anyone that this is the only school to take your children to.

,"THE BEST ATTORNEY I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH!","2009-04-23",,"My wife and I filed Chapter 7 in Dec. 2006. In the spring of 2007 we were hit with a lawsuit from one of the debtors. Our chapter 7 attorney recommended Bill. It was absolutely the best decision.Bill was professional, honest, straightforward and compassionate throughout the almost 21 months it took to win our case. His knowledge of the bankruptcy laws is second to none in my opinion. He also has a great feel for what the other side is thinking and planning. Throughout the entire case, Bill always respected us and treated us more like friends than clients. Bill is very easy to talk to and he listens to his clients. He kept us informed at every turn and returned phone calls and emails promptly.If I ever need a lawyer for any reason in the future, Bill will be my choice. Bills' skills as a lawyer are awesome. His being an awesome person too...a GIFT!","-20ad7674:1363fc0addd:-3ebd","-20ad7674:1363fc0addd:-3ebe"

Combine this with high professionalism, and you have a rare combination in this gem of an aesthetician. As someone who makes a huge effort to shop as close to home (walking distance or short bus ride) as possible, this is the only service I cheerfully make the drive for. No matter how I feel when I arrive, I always leave feeling cared for by a friend."

Everyone was very friendly and quick.  Not at all what we expected.  The food and drinks were great.  We tried the Lettuce wraps because our server suggested them and we were impressed.

We were damn impressed, so my wife made brownies for them.  Pricey, but worth it if your fussy about personal grooming.  Girls are well schooled in old school haircutting.

,"worst place ever!","02/25/09",,"This is the worst place to eat in the whole world! The food is very sub par to down right bad, and the service is just as bad if not worse. My wife and i went their on Friday the 20th 2009 for some dinner after a wedding and had the worst experience i have ever had at a restaurant with service especially from (AMANDA REA) "who was our server" and (BEN) "who was the manager on duty." See first of all when we arrived it took about 10 to 15 min for Amanda to come to talk to us and when she did she did so with an attitude. now i can understand when people have a bad day and all that but she had a scowl on her face and was very rude. At that point i gave her a little bit of a break, but when it continued that is when i draw the line. See I run a 5 star restaurant in downtown Tacoma so i am understanding to a point like i said but mind you it kept going. so we ordered our food my wife had the beef dip and i had a chicken Cesar salad, it took a while for our food ( and the place was pretty much empty only 2 other couples in there and 4 servers) then when our food arrived hers was cold and mine was just not good at all the chicken has very dry and over done and the lettuce well some of it was brown. i never had a chance to tell my server Amanda that the food was not good because i could not find her i even got up and looked for her and asked another server to find her for me please. she never came to my table to fill water or anything, i had to go to the bar to get my own water refilled for both of us. then she finally came to the table to drop off the check about 30min after i tried to find her and neither my wife nor myself had really touched our food at all and Amanda just looked at our food and asked if we wanted it boxed. I could not believe that she said that. so i then asked for the manager and she sent over the bartender who told me the manager (BEN)  was gone for the night all ready and that i can call him tomorrow. so i do call at noon on Saturday and try to talk to the manager (Ben)  but he was at the store i was told so i left a message with my name and phone number. i did not receive a call back so i called to try again at 5pm thinking that for sure Ben would be there now and i was told the same thing buy the same guy i all ready spoke to when i called the first time. so it is now 9pm and i am going to try again so i call and acted as one of Ben's friends and what do you know he comes to the phone. All i can say is WOW this guy BEN is even dumber than AMANDA. i shared my story with him is a very nice respectful manner and he did and said nothing to try and help the situation all he (BEN) did was tell me "you must have been mistaken because Amanda is a very good server and she would never do that and, that he hoped that we would not hold anything against them and come back soon!' WOW this guy is a complete tool. I then asked for the general manager's name and a way to contact them or the owner to contact them as well and he told me that was none of my business or concern. well if i am not mistaken that is public knowledge to know names and maybe not numbers but the names of a restaurant GM AND OWNER ya they are. I hope if anyone knows any of this info they will post it here for me because i would really like to let them know how things work when they are not there. because for every 1 person that tells you about their bad experience 10 others don't and will never come back EVER! and in this day and age with the economy that way it is NO ONE  can afford that kind of bad business.","-20ad7674:1363fc0addd:-4c94"

Found a sofa/ love seat set I loved for over $2,000.

Guess I had been fortunate prior to this to buy from companies that took a bit more pride in their product and customer service.And apparently ( per miss Perky) the store has no supervisor , manager, etc. to discuss problems with... just the sole miss perky.

It's a mom/pop shop where the owner has been in business many years and is very knowledgeable because he is the one doing the majority of the repairs.

,"Shots only","07/30/08",,"I've used "Vets4Less" for a number of years solely for routine vaccinations and rabies shots ONLY. I do not recommend them for any type of surgery major or minor or anything else for that matter. One time when I took my dog in for routine yearly shots I asked the vet to take a look at his eye, (he had been pawing at it for a couple days and I couldn't see anything). The vet took a look at the eye, no drops, no light, and said he didn't see anything and it was fine. Well I took him to his "regular" vet a couple days later and found out he had a sliver in his eye that needed to be removed. This is why I will not endorse anything but simple shots. They are affordable, (cheap to be honest), and I take my dogs there simply because the extra $50 my vet tacks on for the 'office visit' in addition to the cost of shots I feel is asinine."

,"thanks for being so honest and fast","09/11/08",,"One day my car wouldn't start and I'm a DIYer when it comes to simple auto repairs, because in the past I've found that many mechanics cause more problems than they fix. So I went to Autozone with my battery, cables, and starter. I had them bench test all of these components to make sure everything was working properly. The first Autozone said everything tested good, but suggested I replace my negative battery cable as there was a section with extensive corrosion. So I did and went home put everything back together and the engine still wouldn't turn over. I took the same stuff to a different Autozone and they told me the same thing, everything is working fine. I told them that the first one told me that and asked them to test it again. With the same results, I finally got frustrated enough to just give up and let a mechanic work on it. After shopping around I found Carter's had the most positive reviews and they also offer free towing w/ work costing over $300. So I had the car towed to Carter's and within an hour they found the problem. The starter wouldn't turn! It would pop out then go right back in w/out ever engaging the flywheel. They told me my flywheel had some worn teeth but nothing that needed to be replaced immediately. These guys are very honest and upfront and work fast. They had my car in and out in the same day and for a reasonable price. The real test will be to see if the valve cover gaskets that I'm having them do will be done right. As Honda's are notorious for being a pain in the butt to get the seals around the spark plugs to stay put and not leak."

They are unwilling to work with you on late payments or Maintenance issues. we were locked out of our apartment last December after returning from vacation. i forgot the keys. we called the hotline to get a maintenance man to unlock the door. When the woman called me back, she told me that the man said he wouldn't come let me in because it was ten oclock at night and it wasn't his fault that my door was locked shut and i should call a locksmith. i understand that i should have double checked if i had my keys, but it was at least -15 outside and it would have taken him 5 minutes at the most to come let us in.      They never removed the snow in my unit either. i just got sick of it and after working a 12 hour day i would do the stuff myself and my neighbors as well. its not that big of a deal with snow but there were older people in my unit that could have slipped on the ice and hurt themselves. they have great apartments but the people at the desk are rude. i love the buildings, just not the managment.","-20ad7674:1363fc0addd:-74db"

Another stylist (Andrea)  offered to and I agreed althought I was not very happy about it.  My hair was 1 1/2 inches longer on one side than the other. I brought pictures of front, back and sides of the style I wanted.  There are gaps on one side of my hair, which were explained to me that my last stylist shaved my neck and did this which is a joke.  I had to make an appointment in town with another stylist this week to try and straighten out my hair.  I was told that it would have to grow back before I could have another cut to fix the mess.

When I would get out of bed in the morning it actually felt like my back was separating from my hips.  It was quite painful.  My best friend suggested that I see Dr. Dan.  She was confident that he could help me.  I thank God for Dr. Dan.  He completed an exam and took some x-rays and he actually sat with me and went over all of his findings and the recommended treatment plan.  I never felt any pain during treatment, nor did I feel pressured about a certain number of treatments.  My first treatment on the decompression machine was my best experience.  The next morning I can honestly say my back did not feel like it was separating.  I would recommend Dr. Dan to anyone.

I understand people concern for the declining lack of quality... since the new owners its not as "hospitable".  I LOVE the food though, and i always have.  As far as i know they have not changed the recipes, and i LOVE the cheese bread, OH MAN, i def. recommend that!! :)  The place is really cute inside for being a pizza place, very modern looking."

The pedicure tub was full of dirt.  It's really gross.  The toilets dont flush.  This place is absolutely absurd.  This place ruined my whole day.

,"Rudest service imaginable","05/06/08",,"The end of this story is that my friend -- who's EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT and was visiting NYC -- and I were told to stand up from our table and leave the cafe by the rudest, most obnoxious man whom I've ever encountered at a New York City restaurant. It was so shocking and upsetting. We were seated by a waitor at a large table, as we were waiting for a few other friends to make their way to the cafe from other parts of the store. Then the manager came over demanding to know why we were seated without our whole party. We told him that our friends were minutes away. He got in a fight with the waitor who'd seated us, yelling at him over our table in the middle of the restaurant. Then he told us that we had to get up. Motioning at my friend's pregnant belly, I said that if we had to get up we were just going to leave. He said, "You should do that." He stood back glaring at us until we stood up and walked out of the cafe. The manager of the cafe on Saturday afternoons is the type of guy who hurts New York's reputation. As a lifelong New Yorker, I would hope that Fairway doesn't support his kind of hateful rudeness... Apparently they not only support it but reward it by putting him in a management position. I can't review the cafe's food

I was never an Arbys fan when basically it was just the beef and cheese.....but with the new sub type sandwiches, I don't ever have a problem going there. I LOVE the new Classic Italian Sub. I'm not a big fan of the curly fries, but there are usually none left when I am finished with my meal either. It's a good spot to sit in the window and watch the traffic zoom by on the Atlanta Hwy. If there is any down side to this location is the parking lot. I am always worried that somebody will come in from the side road, between them and Mickey D's, while I am watching for traffic entering from the front of Arby's. Of course, they do have a huge lot behind the store, so I guess I could park back there if I wasn't so lazy!! The bathroom have always been clean and the dinning area and tables are usually clean as well. For fast food this place is probably on the better end

,"Cheap prices but terrible receptionist!","01/03/08",,"Looking for a low-cost neuter option, I was referred to this place by a coworker.  While this was about 75 dollars cheaper than my normal vet, I was absolutely disgusted with the customer service of the receptionist.  Every time I called for information prior to the procedure or for post-op pickup information, she was extremely rude and short.  She snapped at my girlfriend the day before the surgery when all she was trying to do was confirm the appointment.  The receptionist snapped "I'm nowhere near a computer right now!" and then quickly put her on hold.  On the day of the operation, I was told he would be ready at 4 or 5.  I got a message around 1:30 that he was ready.  As I was at work, I returned the call at around 3 to tell them I would pick him up at 4 and she said "Well the sooner the better cuz once the animals are picked up we're outta here!"  Does she actually believe that none of their clients have jobs that require them to work to at least 4??!!  She was an absolute b-word (fat biker chic - need I say more) and I am not an easily-iritated person.  So, decide whether poor customer service is worth giving up to save a hundred bucks or so before you decide to go to NPSNC."

First, you have his total attention. You are not handed off to an assistant during any part of your visit, and you know that you have his full attention from start to finish which enables you to feel confident that your hair will turn out phenomenal. Second, Richard has an amazing eye for detail and ability to craft a look that works well on you and looks natural. The proof is in the compliments I get from strangers... he changed my naturally blonde hair to red and new people I meet think red is my natural color. Anyone who knows hair knows that this is a very tricky color change and Richard made it beautiful. What's more amazing is that the haircuts are even better than the color. I have seen Richard create hairstyles on a variety of different types of hair and he always seems to know what works best for each individual. -JR","-20ad7674:1363fc0addd:23c8","-20ad7674:1363fc0addd:23c7"

,"I really like this place.","11/26/07",,"I stumbled upon this forum quite by accident and I have to say I was shocked to see some of the comments.  I have been a client at true for nearly 4 years, shortly after they opened, and while no business is perfect (I own my own as well), I am always impressed with their commitment to excellence.  My hair always looks great (that is what I'm paying for), the two stylists I have used are both professional and friendly and I have received loyalty discounts on both my hair and products I have purchased.  I did have an issue once when my color wasn't what I had hoped for but Ava, the manager, was quick to return my call and get me in the following day to have it corrected.  One time in 4 years is much better than what I have experienced in past salons.  I like that they always call me to remind me of my appointment because my stylist is hard to see (that is why I have seen one other one) and I have to make my appointments a month in advance.  I like to think the fact that it is hard to get an appointment is because they are so good.  As far as I can tell

,"Abundant Animal Care is the best!!","10/23/09",,"I have read every post on this site and have to say that I agree with Dr. Waller that no good deed goes unpunished...I have 2 rescue Lab crosses from Pickens county animal rescue. Durring the spring, on a Saturday, they developed severe symptoms of PARVO. I rushed them to the Emergency Vet Service in Woodstock and had to leave them there. The next morning the vets at the emergency service didn't hold out much hope for the pups...I called a friend of mine and she recomended Dr. Waller, I called and he called right back and told me to bring them right away, After I paid the emergency vet their ransom $1400+ dollars for less than 20 hours of service, I took them to Dr. Waller who waited for me to show up after his regular hours...He took the pups right in and treated them with my children and I looking on...he was more than kind to both the pups and my children and explained what he was doing as he did it, yes
,"The worst ever","10/07/09",,"If you love your animals, do not use Dr. Waller. The operation is the worst I have ever seen for animal care. The place is filthy  and they have horrible service. They give you instructions for return visits to remove stitches and when you show up after driving 50 miles they tell you it's too soon and to come back in a few days anytime before 6. When you go back  before 6 Dr. Waller doesn't even look up from his computer to tell you that you can try to take the stitches and staples out yourself if you want to because they are closed on Wed. after 12. The last time I was there he pulled a growth off a puppy in the waiting room and he started bleeding so bad he told the guy he would keep him overnight and to come back in the morning to pick him up. I was horrified. I will take my dog to another vet and pay to have the stitches and staples removed.

,"It's all in your level with God","06/30/08",,"My review depends on the level of your heart. I attended this church for over 8 years and recently decided it was time to go. Although the foundation of worship and preaching is good and causes you to grow in some things of God, there is no real balance. It always a changing vision. Pastor Daniel has a heart after God and it shows, but most of the people I talked to there over the years have a hard time with his wife, Jennifer Cruz. The manipulating spirit is stong on her and my prayer is that people snap out of it! She is not GOD!!! And therefore can not control people the way I watched her do. I can only imagine how hard it is to manage a church like this, but it worried me and my husband that many genuine leaders were and still are leaving. Why? Something seems wrong in that area. It would seem that not everyone is Jezebel as I have heard them say so they had to get rid of them. Is that what God really thinks about these people that are gone.We wonder if the pastor really sees in the Spirit at whta she does? I allowed my self to get close to leaders and saw them move in such an anointing but as they grew they were totally removed. It seems that it like a controlling spirit. Doesn't a father know his children's heart let alone their name. Please don't get me wrong. It is a good church but I want to be able to grow and not disappear and no one knows what happened. Or at least told the truth! what does the future hold for me at Faith world is what we should ask. They promise so much and put such demands on the people. I was once told by a prophet woman there, whos is gone, that I could see things in people

They were scheduled to be at our apartment at 8am to start loading the truck. They arrived at 7:45am and they were ready to begin work. They loaded up the truck quickly. They were very efficient and professional. They took great care with our possessions. Once we arrived at our new house, they unloaded the truck very quickly. They put all of our furniture in the correct location and they even set up our bed for us. I was so scared to use a moving service because I had heard so many negative things but Marrins' Moving changed this. I would highly recommend them and if we moved again, we would definitely use them again.","-20ad7674:1363fc0addd:4c36","-20ad7674:1363fc0addd:4c35","Marrins' Moving Systems, LTD"

,"Avoid boarding and Dr. Terry Pitts","09/18/06",,"We boarded our two high need cats here for over a week.  I went in a month ahead of time to ask if the vets could handle boarding the animals and their special needs and also gave full medical histories for both of the cats.  Upon dropping off the cats, I gave a typed out sheet with details regarding their medical conditions and also explained to the person all about them.  While we were gone, one of the cats had a medical crisis and they did not call us.  We only found out because they billed us for x-rays. When I asked what this was for the lady from back told the front desk person, "Oh that was supposed to be taken off--they weren't supposed to see that."  It was only after that conversation was overheard did we ask further questions and found out that the cat had severe problems.  When we scheduled a meeting with the owner of the clinic he told us he assumed that this condition or problem was a normal or everyday problem-- even though I kept telling him that I told the vet we saw a month earlier that it was not, told the person we dropped the cats off with that it was not, and also had written on a sheet of care directions that our cat did not have this problem(peeing straight blood) all of the time.  He kept saying that he was under the impression that it was a chronic problem--not taking any responsibility for the breakdown of communication among his staff or even apologizing for not calling or for his staff trying to hide that something went wrong during the stay(which in essence was not even their fault---or was it since they didn't want to tell us?).  At the very end of the conversation when it became clear that there was going to be no apology, he stated that if we really cared about our animals--we should have called.  Funny
,"Dr. Feltz is far more superior than any other vet in the area","03/04/09",,"Hi there, My name is Tonda, I used to live in Manchester and had a special needs cat, Krash, Dr Feltz was awsome helping to keep her comfotable and she had 4 years of great life even after being hit by a car and pelvis broken,, she healed wonderfuly and only needed lactolose to help with plumbing
,"Probably not next time.","03/15/09",,"I was on vacation with a group of 9 people.  We chose Yellowtail as the place to have our formal dinner as a group. Upon arrival, you are able to see that the restaurant is very well decorated and the fixtures and furniture are amazing (of course nothing less would be accepted at the Bellagio)!  They sat us at a round table that we all appreciated.  However you weren't able to focus on the atmosphere because the hip-hop dance music was playing so loud it was difficult to even talk to the person next to you.  (now don't get me wrong - we went clubbing after dinner and hip-hop dance is what were after that nite but with a 5 star level of service the music was really contradictory to the atmosphere).  It was also very dark - almost so much so that it was hard to read the menu.We were greated promptly and presented with the wine and saki menu.  They have no warm saki so I chose a cold saki that they were out of.  The sommelier was sent over to make other recommendations but it was just as though she was reading from the saki menu, not really making any suggestions or asking me what I had in mind. Therefore on my third try for a drink I opted for a cocktail, but other members of my party got sparkling saki that they enjoyed. Our server was prompt and seemed very knowledgeable.  He made great recommendations, many of which we tried.  This is not your typical sushi roll restaurant!  They had the best albacore tuna and yellowtail sashimi that I have ever eaten (and I have eaten sashimi all over the world). Other members of my party enjoyed the spicy tuna snapping roll - I recommend you try it!  The cucumber salad was heavenly with a sesame dresssing.  The espresso was wonderful at the end of meal with dessert!I felt as though I was constantly being bombarded with an arm in my face by the staff as they were rushing to get straw and chopstick wrappers out of the way because we were being rushed onto the next course of our meal.  Even though we made it clear to our server that we were not going to be sharing, the style of the food service was to be enjoyed by the group and the food was "auctioned off" at the table - this was not pleasing when you are trying to carry on conversation and you are constantly interrupted by: "Who had the...".  If I wanted lunch counter service, I would have gone to a deli.The prices for each dish were very much based on quality and not quantity.  Some members of our party actually left hungry (and no one was on a budget).  The view that this restaurant boasts about is not as you would hope for.  Unless you are a small party of two sitting directly in front of one of the window/doors then all you are able to see is bursts of water periodically.  You are able to enjoy the fountain show much more from outside.Overall this experience was slightly pleasureable and never forgettable

,"Love a Pet","07/14/08",,"I have purchase two pembroke welsh corgis from Love a Pet. One was a red and white and the other, a tri. Both of which are excellent dogs and very loving. It's unfortunate that other dogs were sold being so unhealthy. I handled both of my dogs before purchasing. Yes, it is true that the staff there is not very willing to assist. But in both my situations they fully went over the contract of purchase, the good and the bad. I also want to say that my dogs are continuously complimented on their beautiful color and markings and are AKC registered. The puppies are kept in small cages, I would not recommend buying an older dog just because you never know how long that dog has been there. I do know however, that Love a Pet has a VERY high turnover rate for the majority of their dogs. So, just be wary
,"Baby Rabbits","05/28/08",,"I recently purchased a Mini Rex rabbit for my son. We had her for less than a month and she became very ill. Within hours of her becoming ill, we were meeting our vet for an emergency call that cost us $148 and we still lost our baby. Afterwards I did some research into what could have been the cause of this terrible ordeal. I believe that Love A Pet is taking these babies away from their mothers at too young of an age and selling them to people who have no idea what kind of situation they are getting themselves into. This baby was three weeks old, according to what I was told by a store employee, when they received her, and that is way too young to be taken away from her mother. They have not yet developed the immunities that they need for survival on their own. It makes me so angry every time I think about losing her the way we did. I thought that we were doing everything that we should to make sure she was happy and healthy and in all actuality, she never had a chance. It was just a matter of time before she became ill and once this happens there is very little chance that the baby will survive. Out entire family was devastated when we lost her less than 30 days later, we had all become very attached to her. Love A Pet owes it to their customers to inform them of these risks involved when purchasing a rabbit that is too young. Yes

It's great for a young, hip, "W" vibe, but more boutiquey...with a Portland vibe.  Definitely recommend.",

Trainers are friendly and well educated.  However, the musci is so boring.  Who can work out to James Blunt?  The equipment is old, when the new owners took over two years ago we were promised new equipment, but the only place that got it was the "co-ed studio".  This place has more potential than the energy they seem to give it to improve.  They like to keep you involved in a comunity atmosphere so that is nice, and like I mentioned the staff are fantastic!  It feels like they want to cater to an older woman clientell rather than women of all ages.  Being a member for over 3 years now, I am begining to ponder if the gym floor environment promotes the motivation I am needing.  I love that the staff has noticed when I lost 15 pounds.  There attentiveness makes coming every day worth it. Its a catch 22 at this point",

At Hallmark Opticians all who work there are always very helpful and give me all the time I need.

Seated next to them were a mom and her young son trying to enjoy a meal. After several trumpets of the f word and other unacceptable verbage, folks from surrounding tables got uncomfortable and left. I was disappointed the nearby staff seemed to shrug it off as nothing, and essentiallly condoned it. I felt uncomfortable for the mom. To be sure

Last time we were in a group of eight, which I knew would be a mistake, but I figured my family members from the suburbs knew of the place and wouldn't be scared to eat there. The dining room was so cramped, we could hardly get up to use the bathroom...which would probably be a good thing since the bathroom was so disgusting I felt like I was at an old truck stop. The floor of the dining room was so slippery with grease that I nearly fell. Service was not good. Food was average....I mean...it's just tex-mex. The prices last time I went were WAY more than what most Mexican food places in that area charge. The prices would be expensive even if it were a fancy place in the 'burbs! It's pretty obvious why. The parking lot was filled with high-end SUV's and I didn't actually see any Mexicans eating there. This place is purely a "ghetto-chic" trandy place for out-of-towners to get the Tex-Mex food they know from the suburbs. If you're wanting to impress your friends by taking them to a Mexican place in a neighborhood where they wouldn't normally go to, try any of the countless other places in the area. Don't be scared...just pick any one of them and simply stop in...most of them have more authentic food, and WAY better prices. I mean

He gave me a call the next day  and said I need a new rotor and ignition coil. He said it would be "about $200." First of all I am skeptical when mechanics name two things that are preventing my car from starting. I suspect there was nothing wrong with the rotor. Maybe it was a little worn but nothing that would prevent the car from starting. That's just my assumption though so I won't hold that against him. I told him to fix it. When I went to pickup and pay for the car the bill was $344, nearly 75% more than what he quoted me. There was extreme markup on the parts and $184 in labor to change a rotor and ignition coil! Also they tacked on $10 in "garage supplies." I confronted him about it and he dropped it down to $270; so we split the difference. The work seems good but I won't return just because I truly believe he was trying to slide one by me. If you do go, request a written estimate.

,"Dr. Bahou","02/03/09",,"I am a former employee of Dr. Bahou. I was terminated from my job at Alisos Animal Hospital and even still, I must admit that Dr. Bahou is a wonderful veterinarian. Not only does he have the special one on one "touch" with animals who seem to "take to him" very quickly but he truly loves them with all his heart. As an employee there have been plenty of times when Dr. Bahou has asked me for his advice as far as what to charge clients and if "he was being fair".He has always reinforced the principles of honesty to me, something which I have inherently been taught by my parents as well. Hence it was easy to relate to Dr. Bahou when he wanted to do the right thing for every animal that stepped foot (paw) in his office. I can only judge Dr. Bahou in this review based on his skills and empathy as a Veterinarian. The same cannot be said about his judgment skills about his staff. Dr. Bahou does not have good judgement when it comes to honoring and supporting his staff. Valuable employees are often overlooked, misunderstood and terminated. This is what happened to me.This is why there is so much turnover. However I am eternally grateful to Dr. Bahou for his generous referrals and positive recommendations to his long time clients about me. His willingness to share his business with me always made me proud. Dr. Bahou is the reason I was able to launch my petsitting business.Despite my current circumstances;specifically the fact that I live paycheck to paycheck and this termination has offset my plans temporarily, I am still a firm believer in God and I still have nothing but the best wishes for Dr. Bahou and his career with animals.

When I got no real answer about the sauces I asked if the chef might grill a piece of fish or chicken with a little diced mango (mango was all over the menu as well as fish and chicken) and put it on some brown rice - NOTHING  fancy, out of the ordinary or time consuming.  It should have been quite easy to do.  What came was a dry bowl of rice and a salad sized plate of bone dry chicken.  It was as tough as jerky, no mango, butter, oil,  nothing on the dry chicken.  When asked about the mango she brought some slices of dry hard mango but seemed angry that we had asked.  We spoke to the manager (with the chef present) and both looked at us blankly like we were a nuisance, not a customer.

When first going to Sagra i was impressed with the quality and cleanliness  Very good quality. The dining room is simple.  You can order beer, wine or a cocktail with your meal if you eat in. It is a very homey atmosphere designed to allow the food to be the diamond in the rough..and there are 8 outside tables with umbrellas. I have eaten there many times (>10) and all the food I have eaten has been very good. Quickly prepared, served hot. Crispy is crispy, juicy is juicy, fresh is fresh.

Good points: They were fast to give me a free quote and to send me emails. They were professional and responsible. Overall, I am glad that I used their service because their job was fast.Bad points: They sent me a draft before they mailed to me, but I found a few mistakes they did that were really easy translation, that made me wondered if the translator was native Japanese

He wasn't a horribly out of control dog, but the kids next door were teasing him and he was becoming sensitive about people in his space. He was also just never very well trained by us--and those of you who have seen labradoodles know they are no small dog. The training provided by Josiah was excellent--my dog is responsive in ways I never thought possible. Financially I thought it was a good deal. It always seems like a lot of money when you are paying for a somewhat unknown product, but I became more and more confident as I received the weekly updates. In the end I am very sure it was well worth both the time away from Rudy and the money. I would recommend them with no reservations whatsoever. It's a long time to be without your pet, but the results for the animal's and pet owner's lives together are well worth the wait.","-20ad7674:1363fc0fb96:-1fa5","-20ad7674:1363fc0fb96:-1fa6","Neuman K-9 Academy

Sonya takes the time to listen to you even if she has been doing your hair for years, as is my case.  Never is she locked into one mode that suits you.  I have gone long, short, really short, back to medium and then started the whole thing over again.  As for colour... insanely red, back to natural, platnuim blonde

The Salon will give you a more efficient route.  This place insantly gives you a cosy feeling. I like that. it was easy for me to listen to some of the advice on hair coloring, and cut. I looked at pictures for about 10 minutes, and we went over exactly what I wanted. The results were just  a great success.I usually don't write reviews, but the owner was so thoughtful.

I was looking forward to this day for so long and just assumed that I would not have to shop any farther. I was expecting the cakes to taste wonderful since the bakery is so big and popular. Well, I was so wrong. I went with my mother and my son and they both agreed with me. The frostings were blah ... Lots of Crisco to the taste.  The cake itself was nothing special.  I found the cassada cake to be the only one that was worth thinking about...but we did not like the nondairy whipped cream frosting they made. The frosting was the problem....it just tasted like Cool Whip when eaten alone. My son loves cake but did not want anymore after the first piece.  We couldn't help but chuckle when he innocently said we should just buy a cake from Giant Eagle.  I was surprised that the staff really weren't helpful....even though there were not many people there in attendance. Aren't they trying to "sell" cakes?

We did not have anyone come up and talk to us about what kind of cake we were looking for and I never got an answer to my one question I had...." How big is a serving" of cake....since it is sold by servings.  Nobody knew the answer....and nobody seemed to want to find out.   I surely would like to know what size the piece will be on my guests plate.   Not an uncommon request, I do not think.

If you're like me, then don't go to this salon.  The salon is extremely busy, so the assistants are only concerned about getting you out of the shampoo bowl and moving on to the next person.  They do not condition your hair properly - you're lucky if they work the conditioner through your entire head of hair.  Also, the stylists seem to have the same attitude, and they basically want to get you in and out.  Most of them do not take the time to cut your hair properly.   Lastly, I must add that the salon has a lot of potential but it unfortunately falls short due to lack of professionalism."

And they gave us a lifetime warranty !! After meeting them at our home & agreeing to their price ( VERY REASONABLE!!) they sent the installers out two days later and had the whole garage door converted in 3/1/2 hours.

,"Best Greek food outside of Greek town","11/21/06",,"We love Yanni's. Everytime we visit we have an excellent meal, great service and a great seat. There really isn't a bad seat in Yanni's. It has multiple levels on in the main dining room. On the other side by the bar it is flat if levels are not manageable. In the summer they block off a portion of the patio and ring it with evergreen trees so it feels secluded. The entire indoors is decorated like you are in the heart of the mediterranean, but it is simple and elegant. It has great views of an outdoor pond by the windows or nice and cozy by the fireplace. It also has warm lighting, but not so dim you cannot see. It also has good acoustics so even when it is busy you can hear clearly. The prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious. We have never been disappointed in any item off the menu. Yanni's has a good wine list with several greek wines and popular favorites. It's also easy on and off the Kennedy since it's only a block away. There isn't any valet parking, but it's not needed since it has a huge parking lot.",,"-20ad7674:1363fc0fb96:-fc3"

,"Tipping wasn't getting me anywhere...","November 28, 2007","business","I'd almost given up on tipping all together after eating at so many "top" houses in Seattle.  I'd come to expect that my server didn't care about me anymore then the 20% I was going to leave them.  94 has shown me that it doesn't have to be that way.  They actually have staff that really do care if I come back and are not just trying to get my money out of my pocket.  The menu selections are limited to what's fresh and I was told many are even sourced directly from the Pike Place Market.  Is bad service a requirement of these other houses that the management just expects?  The slop house buffet comes to mind with the concept of turn and burn being the norm.  I'll be back 94 and thank you for having a dedication to great food and treating me like more then a green back.","-20ad7674:1363fc0fb96:10cc","-20ad7674:1363fc0fb96:10ca","94 Stewart Restaurant","http://www.94stewart.com","http://pix.sustainlane.com/l/u/X/p/Y/b.jpeg"

It would have been fine to me and my husband to go home after finding out we were not in true labor.  The next thing I knew, Matsunage (cannot call him "Dr.) came into the room, opened a drawer and stuck a long yellow thing up me to break the water.  I was yelling out, "Stop, please i'll go home, I don't want this!"  He said it's the best thing to do to just get you delivered (even though I was only 38 weeks along) and did not listen to me.  I started crying (how humiliating) - he is a butcher, stay away  He stuck his hands up me and twisted and turned until a bunch of blood emitted from my vagina - he then told me he opened me up to 4 with his fingers.  It was so uncomfortable I also fell off the bed.  He did not listen to me and frankly I felt like nothing more than a piece of meat."

,,,,"I started listening to indian classical music about 15 years ago. I’ve always enjoyed it, but I’ve never really known much about the actual form of the music. A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of seeing Ravi Shankar perform with his daughter Anoushka. It was a truly fascinating experience and greatly deepened my interest in the music. I spent some time with Google and Wikipedia learning about the form of the music and the instruments that they play and also came across this CD on iTunes. This has a number of excellent performances by Ravi Shankar, but also includes some dialog from Ravi himself discussing the music and how it works. There’s a short introductory track about indian classical music in general, along with an introduction to each piece where Ravi speaks a little about the ascending and descending scales used in the Raga and the Rhythmic pattern that will be used. This is fascinating stuff and makes you appreciate the astounding level of complexity and virtuosity that exists within the music. The only downside is that the recording is mono, but that doesn’t really detract that much from something so fascinating. Overall, a great introduction to Indian classical music aimed at western listeners.",

One of my favorite flatbread sandwiches there is the chicken and roots sandwich.    Everything I have had there tastes as fresh as just being picked from their garden.  The soups also make an excellent, healthy choice for a side dish and they make you feel satisfied.Now the major downside of these restaurants:  Everything is expensive!  I mean very!  I can go to McDonalds and buy two value meals and still spend less than having just one sandwich and a drink at O'Naturals.  So now you think to yourself, no wonder everyone does not choose the healthier organic food.  Only the small number who have that thick flow of income annually are able to taste this delicious food without any unreasonable burden on their daily salary.I have hope that someday, O'Naturals will become affordable to many more and even become a significant competitor with other fast food companies.  As I like to say, food, not nutrients

This is an adult Dark Knight story that is well-told, packs some truly fun gameplay elements, has topnotch voice talent, and feel like it's part of Batman canon.

Well my sister didn't love the dried nectarines.  She complained that they were too tough, too chewy.   She compared it to the soft dried apricots she usually gets from Trader Joe's ("T.J.'s Slab Apricots).  So I decided to do a little research.  Why were Hollow Frog nectarines so hard and chewy?  (By the way, the flavor of the nectarines is delicious). It might have to do with the difference in fruit.  Nectarines vs. apricots.  Then I compared ingredients between F.H. and T.J's dried fruits and discovered that T.J's apricots were not all-natural, but contained sulfur dioxide. I learned that sulfur is added to dried fruit to preserve color.  I'm not sure that sulfur has any effect on the softness of the fruit, but I'd be weary of eating any product that contains a non-natural preservative for its cosmetic effect.","-20ad7674:1363fc13df6:-dff"

,"WOW","January 16, 2008",,"WOW..What a bed, have never slept so good. I have had problems sleeping for quit a while - tossing and turning, back pain, hurt so bad at times had to get up and sleep in my recliner- would sleep about 1 1/2 hours and wake up and the could only doze waking 4-5 times every night...NOW I sleep all the through, don't toss and turn and no more back pain. I got the adjustable 5000 - I raise the head about 6 inches and set to 70..fantastic-found my number first night. I found the comercials hard to believe, but after no sleeping for months decided to try the bed...WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG..ALL I CAN SAY IS -----WOW---WHAT A BED."

The compressor is nearly silent; I have a tiny studio--the fridge is practically next to my bed--but I've never been bothered by its sounds.

Very easy to rearrange shelves and it's so great to see everything inside-no losing things for months that get hidden in the back! On the negative side, the light in the frig is very dim and there is no light in the freezer. If you keep a lot of frozen food, this is not the freezer for you. Yes, there are three compartments, but the top compartment is taken up by the ice cube trays(I do like having that seperate compartment) and is about 4inches high underneath that. The second compartment is larger but doesn't have the whole depth of the frig and the bottom drawer is a tilt-out with hardly any depth. So, no loading up on the frozen pizza sale! The last thing I was completely unaware of, is that the back of the frig is completely open-the compressor area is uncovered-so you will need to be vigilant about pulling it out to clean if you have pet hair flying around.(Plus side

I rigged up one and dropped it in my tackle box expecting to test it out and see how it swam, with little to no expectations.I tied it on to my baitcaster, launched it out twice as far as I've ever cast anything and started swimming it back. About half way through my retrieve I got impatient and so I started burning it back as fast as I could to get it off my line and give up on it.

,"50LB. 2-Speed Reel","December 14, 2008",,"Bought this reel as a 50lb. set-up for two-day trips out of San Diego. Broke the reel in fishing rockfish this winter, playing with the two speed option and worked like a charm. Switching between gears was smooth and worked like a winch. Can't wait for this summer to try out on the pelagics. Stand by for follow-up report. This reel has its unique feel from Avet reels and it's made in the US.","-20ad7674:1363fc17852:-2f1",,,

,"Great product","July 29, 2008",,"After trying many other "top quality" scents in the past, I bought a bottle of Golden Estrus half way through last archery season. This stuff works! I had buck coming into scrapes during daylight hours that I had only seen on my game cams at night. I freshened the scrapes with a few drops every morning and the bucks kept coming back in search of the doe daily. I put some on an older scrape that hadn't been used in weeks and within 2 days the scrape had increased in size from an area the size of a trash can lid to the size of a car hood. My confidence in the freshness of this product is unequalled by anything else I have used.","-20ad7674:1363fc17852:-3d1","-20ad7674:1363fc17852:-3d2","Wildlife Research Center® - Special Golden Estrus® Doe Urine","http://reviews.basspro.com/2010/9627/"

,"Kwik Drop Masterpiece","July 8, 2008",,"Finally a marine product worth the money! I have always been aggravated with having to take my seat down to run to my next honey hole. This product cures that problem. No more wasted energy, time and floor space. It is just as strong and stable as a fixed position pedestal. The only little bit of wobble that you do get from it, is when it is in the down position and you are running in rough water. But there is no way that it can come out or be stolen as long as your compartments are locked, because of the hitch pin used underneath the deck.

,"Looks Smooth, Feels Smooth","July 13, 2009",,"I love this reel. I paired this up on a 6.6 M Carrot Stix with 14 lb. BPS Flourocarbon line and it performs wonderfully. The biggest plusses for me are the click drag and cast control knobs. They make it quite easy to control and gauge how tight you have your settings. Very minimal backlashes (only some from user error) and casts extremely far. My fishing buddy was using his Abu Ambassaduer and I was launching my line almost twice as far as he was. Needless to say he was quite jelous.Plus the reel looks very classy and sleek.","-20ad7674:1363fc17852:-803","-20ad7674:1363fc17852:-804","Bass Pro Shops® Johnny Morris Signature Series Baitcast Reel","http://reviews.basspro.com/2010/90567/"

,"Oversize Tent Cot","February 28, 2007",,"The oversize tent cot is the way to go if you want comfort and dependability. I started with the standard tent cot and loved it., but being 6'2" and 240 #, I found that the oversized version was just perfect on weekend packing trips. I loved it so much, I bought a double tent cot so my wife can experience the great outdoors with me without having to deal with blow up matresses, rocks under your tent, and the inevitable flood that everyone has experienced during a rainfall while trying to sleep in a conventional tent. I have never slept so well knowing that I was 11" off of the ground and away from those creepy crawleys that come visiting in the night. While the price might give you cause for concern

I purchased these as a Chirstmas gift for my mother who has everything and needs nothing. It was something that caught her eye once, and with her discerning tastes, I had to search for the best quality, at the best price. I found it! At last
,"Outstanding Product","December 10, 2008",,"You will not regret this purchase. I originally purchased this product (in black) because they are thin and light weight for early fall base layer scent control . They work great. I have taken two does so far both of them were down wind from me. One doe was within nine yards (bow hunting, 120 lb mature deer). By the way, I hunt public land and the deer here in north-east Oklahoma are very educated. The additional side benefit as mentioned previously is bug control. Get the baklava and bottoms as I did. With proper scent control of your accessories you will be amazed at how close deer will come to you. I went back and purchased the camo top and baklava for next year. You can hand wash these, wring them out, and be hunting within two hours. Great price, excellent quality

,"Fast Service","July 24, 2007",,"I want to thank you for my order. Requesting color samples and placing my order was quick and easy. I was impressed with how quickly it arrived, packed very carefully for safe shipping. I was a little nervous about installing a large sliding glass door blind on my own. However, the step-by-step instructional DVD was extremely helpful! It fit perfectly. Quality was great and price was right. I had previously had a Hunter Douglas rep. provide a quote for the EXACT same blind, and it was $300 more than what I paid through blinds.com. Thank you so much for a great experience! I would definitely recommend your site to friends.","-20ad7674:1363fc17852:254",

,"Sheerweave Solar Shade","April 9, 2008",,"I searched for a long time for the best option on my front living room window and struggled with what I wanted. I wasn't looking for a privacy blind, but I wanted to block the sun rays coming through the window creating glare on my tv and shining in my eyes. My window was a special order size so I found the price range to be substantial for other blinds and still wasn't exactly what I wanted. I stumbled across blinds.com on the internet and found exactly what I was looking for and the price was incredible. Even with the shipping for the extra large window, it was still the best buy out there. Ordering was easy, shipment came fast, installation was a breeze and to my surprise it was perfect. I couldn't be happier with the results. The product is durable and the color choices were great. I couldn't beleive my eyes. Our blind did exactly what I wanted. It blocked the sun rays but we could still see outside perfectly. Thank you so much for such a wonderful product. I show and tell all my friends and tell them about the website. The rest is up to them. I would definately purchase products at blinds.com again.","-20ad7674:1363fc17852:30f"

Bottom line is I have returned to them time and time again. I will keep doing so.

,"I love these.","November 21, 2008",,"The Pecan color matches my wood wrapped windows perfectly. You would have thought the wood wraps and the blinds were the same material!The blinds are in my kitchen, living room, and foyer. You can see all the windows in these areas at the same time due to my open floor plan, so I wanted the exact same blinds in all the windows.The Routeless feature is great. Makes the blinds look much more formal. I was able to hang all of them myself even though they are pretty heavy. I am glad I got 2 on 1 headrail for my 70 by 58 inch front room window because they would be much too heavy to open otherwise. The blinds are all inside mount and barely have any gap at all between the wood wrap and blind material itself.I also got the matching vertical blinds for my sliding glass door and am happy with them.","-20ad7674:1363fc17852:714","-20ad7674:1363fc17852:713"
