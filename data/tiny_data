,"Ooooooh","06/03/05",,"I swoon just thinking about this bakery.  It has the best, most rich cookies in the universe.  They are huge, dense, too sweet for some but use great, creative ingredients (ex. their oatmeal raisin cookie uses golden raisins).  Like no other.  Chocolate lovers don't miss the Mocha Cookie.  ooooh it's like eating crunchy espresso fudge.  I also especially love their oatmeal raisin, their ginger cookies, and their almond cookies with choc or jam filling.  YUM!!!  They also serve Peet's Coffee drinks.  On the other side of the bakery they serve good sandwiches
,"The best cookies on the planet","12/06/06",,"Do yourself a favor and try these cookies. I savor each crumb of the mocha chip cookies. This one will break your diet in two bites. Also, their cheese danishs are the best around. Pick up a dozen for your co-worker or family.","-20ad7674:1363fc05114:-10bd","-20ad7674:1363fc05114:-10be","Some Crust Bakery","http://www.insiderpages.com/b/",

,"Grimely carpets come clean","05/08/06",,"Our 10-year old carpets have seen a lot of use and over the years, it was starting to show. Many cleaners have tried to clean them (both professionally and on our own). But the stains always reappeared. Only Lewis Carpet Cleaners was able to get the carpets clean so that the stains did NOT return.","-20ad7674:1363fc05114:-11f8","-20ad7674:1363fc05114:-11f9","Lewis Carpet Cleaners, Inc.","http://www.insiderpages.com/b/"
,"Hated this place","07/29/08",,"I was recently overcharged for fillings that suddenly appeared after regular visits to this office for two years.  The fillings weren't even found by the dentist who examined my teeth, but by the dental technician who did my cleaning.","-20ad7674:1363fc05114:-124c","-20ad7674:1363fc05114:-124d","MV Dental Grp","http://www.insiderpages.com/b/",
,"Awsome","08/14/05",,"This place is the best place in the city to go on a first date. It is entertaining and really funny. The exhibits are all hands-on and really keep all ages engaged. The store isn't that great, but it has that good astronaut ice cream that you ate when you were a kit. Also, I would recommend checking out the Tactile Dome","-20ad7674:1363fc05114:-1435","-20ad7674:1363fc05114:-1436","Exploratorium","http://www.insiderpages.com/b/"
,"great fun","08/30/05",,"The Exploratorium is a great hands-on science museum for kids of all ages.  It's actually pretty interesting for adults too!   Kids won't even realize they're learning so much because they'll be having fun too.  Lots of great exhibits and they always have something new.","-20ad7674:1363fc05114:-143b","-20ad7674:1363fc05114:-143c","Exploratorium","http://www.insiderpages.com/b/",,"http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3710038907"
,"My hair NEVER looked this good","07/07/06",,"Sarah is the best!!  Great listener! The consultation was wonderful, her explanations of the styling techniques and the products she used were very helpful and easy to follow.  It was a nice atmosphere, clean and friendly.  It was more expensive than what I am used to but I don't every remember walking out of a salon with my hair feeling and looking this good.  Sarah even called to follow up with me, making sure everything was ok with my cut and checking to see if I had set up my next appointment.  This is excellence in customer service",,"-20ad7674:1363fc05114:-1517","Mane Attraction Salon"
,"Keep up the great work!","03/26/07",,"Mane Attraction is a very unusual salon, sometimes it's hard to find friendly service in an upscale salon.  The attitude towards their customers is refreshing.  I loved how everything was explained to me, so I could style it at home.  Great job!",,"-20ad7674:1363fc05114:-151d","Mane Attraction Salon","http://www.insiderpages.com/b/"
